### 🛠 Data analysis for SERS quantification
Surface-enhanced Raman scattering is a powerful analytical technique that enables multiplexed detection of biomolecules in complex environments. However, manually interpreting spectra can be challenging and tedious, especially when multiple analytes are present. Machine learning techniques can be used to extract additional information from the spectra and predict the analyte concentrations of unseen samples.
